## Project - Creating an Adaptive System for Gamifying Physiotherapy

This project contains the source files of the delivery for **Group 10** in the course **TDT4290**. The group has been working with the customer, **NTNU Physiotherapy**. NTNU physiotherapy is a department at NTNU working with research regarding physiotherapy and other health-related topics. Their needs were concerned with **mobile health applications**.

The goal of the project stemmed from the customer’s research on exercise data related to patients with disabilities or other special needs. For this
project, the group has worked in the context of **re-training the pelvic muscle after childbearing**.

As such, the group has divided the project into **three deliverable repositories**:
1. [A mobile application supporting gamified exercises through Bluetooth devices](https://github.com/TDT4290-Gruppe-10/kegeland-app)
2. [Dashboard application used for visualizing exercise data](https://github.com/TDT4290-Gruppe-10/kegeland-frontend)
3. [An API to handle data flow between the dashboard and mobile application](https://github.com/TDT4290-Gruppe-10/kegeland-api)

> Inside each repository listed above you will find a guide on how to **get started**
